[2018-05-31 15:49:59.978] [jointLog] [info] Computed 157 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-05-31 15:49:59.978] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1009 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-05-31 15:49:59.980] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1009 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.

[2018-05-31 15:49:59.980] [jointLog] [warning] Since only 1009 (< 5000000) fragments were observed, modeling of the fragment start position distribution has been disabled
