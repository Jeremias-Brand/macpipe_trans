[2018-05-31 15:50:04.210] [jointLog] [info] Computed 134 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-05-31 15:50:04.210] [jointLog] [info] Counted 992 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-05-31 15:50:04.212] [jointLog] [warning] Only 992 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.

[2018-05-31 15:50:04.212] [jointLog] [warning] Since only 992 (< 5000000) fragments were observed, modeling of the fragment start position distribution has been disabled
